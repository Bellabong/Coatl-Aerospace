		VallInSpaceHigh = In sector 637-K the particles are fine and grainy but here they are more coarse.  I think we found...dirt!
		
		TyloInSpaceLow = The device measures a large impact, followed by many smaller impacts.
		TyloInSpaceHigh = That sound was not the result of an impact but rather was directly caused by space food.  KLANG!  THAT was in impact!
		
		BopInSpaceLow = Flight, Mission Control. You did not, in fact, just collide with Bop.
		BopInSpaceHigh = Mission Control, Flight.  Did we just collide with Bop?
		
		PolInSpaceLow = Judging from the impact, we may have impacted something crystalline in nature. 
		PolInSpaceHigh = Pol, polled politely, properly produced predicted principles of impacts.
		
		EelooInSpaceLow = Even out here, it seems spacecraft have to deal with space debris.
		EelooInSpaceHigh = We came, we saw, we got hit by more rocks.
		
		AsteroidInSpaceLow = Pieces of the asteroid seem to have broken off from the activity around it...
		AsteroidInSpaceHigh = WAIT!  No one said anything about rocks around the rock.
		AsteroidSrfLanded = The detector pings angrily as it is pelted from the debris of our landing.
